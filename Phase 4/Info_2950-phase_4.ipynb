    "## Introduction\n",
    "The question of happiness has been commonly pondered and explored throughout history. People have constantly looked for the best way to live their lives and seek happiness. Whether it's defined by personal achievements, meaningful relationships, or moments of delight, the concept of happiness is an important part of the human experience, shaping our perspectives, decisions, and the overall quality of our lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research aims to shed light on this question by examining how different areas of life can play a role in influencing countries' happiness scores. Though happiness has been commonly studied, our research is differentiated because it combines the impact of different factors in the areas of health, economics, and demography, which are typically analyzed separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, factors we have chosen to study are suicide rate, birth rate, minimum wage, crime index, and population size. We chose factors from a wide range of areas because we are interested in understanding if different aspects of lifestyle (ie. health, economics, and demography) have more weight than others in influencing happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how these various factors can influence happiness is important on a personal level because every individual is invested in their own happiness. However, this research can also be used extract broader insights into the way different societies are structured and how that can subsequently affect happiness. Thus, the findings from this research can be used as a basis for informing policy decisions that can have the potential to increase happiness worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms\n",
    "1) **Suicide rate**: Number of suicide deaths in a year, divided by the population and multiplied by 100,000.\n",
    "(Source: https://www.who.int/data/gho)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **World happiness score**: A publication that contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors.\n",
    "(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Population size**: The number of individuals present in a subjectively designated geographic range. (Source: https://www.nature.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Minimum wage**: The lowest remuneration that employers can legally pay their employees—the price floor below which employees may not sell their labor. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Crime index**: The crime rate per 1,000 population for all crimes in a specific neighborhood or city. (Source: https://help.neighborhoodscout.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Birth rate**: The total number of live human births per 1,000 population for a given period divided by the length of the period in years. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **Bootstrapping**: A method of inferring results for a population from results found on a collection of smaller random samples of that population, using replacement during the sampling process. (Source: https://www.mastersindatascience.org/learning/machine-learning-algorithms/bootstrapping/)\n",
    "\n",
    "8) **Heteroskedasticity**: Happens when the standard deviations of a predicted variable, monitored over different values of an independent variable or as related to prior time periods, are non-constant. (Source: https://www.investopedia.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "10) **Multivariable linear regression**: A statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. (Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mlr.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question:\n",
    "**Main Question**: Among the factors of suicide rate, birth rate, minimum wage, crime index, and population size, which are the most prominent in influencing “happiness”? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we use the following sub-questions to assist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Is there a relationship between the levels of suicide rate and a country's happiness score?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Do birth rates, minimum wage, and crime index have correlations to population size? And does the population size have a relationship with happiness score? \n"

    "## Data Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "### __MOTIVATION__\n",
    "__Why was this dataset created?__\n",
    "- Our dataset was created to observe the factors that influenced life satisfaction in various countries. We wanted to isolate factors that demonstrated the strongest correlation to overall happiness. The five datasets we analyzed all compared individual factors that would influence or measure the wellbeing of the country. Their purpose was to capture the overall state of different countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Who funded the creation of the dataset?__\n",
    "- These datasets took information from organizations like the “World Health Organization”, “World bank” statistics, United Nations Statistics, and other datasets. It is unclear who funded these datasets. \n",
    "### __Composition__\n",
    "__Is any information missing from individual instances?__\n",
    "- There is information missing from individual instances, such as data from smaller countries like Andorra, which may have less resources to collect the data. These rows of missing values have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?__\n",
    "\n",
    "- For these datasets, the rows are the names of countries, and the columns are health, economic, and demography factors. These include number of suicides, infant mortality rate, crime rates, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?__\n",
    "- The data has mainly been collected from research studies, using methods such as surveys. Thus, there could be several biases that could have influenced data collection, such as selection bias, sampling bias, and social desirability bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Collection Process__\n",
    "__How was the data associated with each instance acquired?__\n",
    "- We gathered the data from various CSV files in order to analyze various facets of influential attributes that impacted a nation. The individual CSV files took data from large health organizations that measured population statistics. Some examples are the \"https://ourworldindata.org/\", the \"Sustainable Development Solutions Network\", and the \"World Health Organization\".\n",
    "\n",
    "__Over what timeframe was the data collected?__\n",
    "- Our research analyzed data from the year 2013 to 2023. This data allows us to predict the more recent trends in Happiness levels, GDP, birth rate, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?__\n",
    "- The data scrapped data from large organizations that provided public data. They also took data from previous research studies that used the same data. The data was changed to its current form once we removed less relevant columns and collected the correlation value. Additionally we dropped empty column values to focus on the analyzable data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __Uses__\n",
    "__Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted on Github, in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).__\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we used 6 datasets. They can be found in their raw data sources as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mental health disorders dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/Mental%20health%20Depression%20disorder%20Data.csv\n",

    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/crime-rate-by-country-2023.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Country and continent dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/countryContinent.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Happiness information dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/2022.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "__What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?__\n",
    "- These datasets contain a lot of rich information that can be used for a variety of different tasks. For example, other ideas that could be studied include the patterns between education levels and human development, between labor force participation and overall economic performance, and between urbanization trends and environmental consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?__\n",
    "- Some potential tasks that these data should not be used for are visualizing trends over time, because not all the datasets include data over time. Additionally, further verification of the data should be done before using it to inform any policy recommendations.\n",

    "## Preregistration Statements\n",
    "**Hypothesis 1**: \n",
    "Countries that are reported to have an overall higher rate of happiness will experience lower levels of suicide rates. \n",
    "**Analysis**: We will run a linear regression model to determine if there is a relationship between happiness score and suicide rates (number of suicides per 100,000 people).This would be our formula: Happiness Score = α + βsuicide_rate * Suicide Rate + ε. We will be looking to see if βsuicide_rate < 0, to determine if there is a negative correlation between happiness and suicide rates per country.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2**: \n",
    "Smaller population sizes of countries correspond to lower birth rates, higher minimum wages, and lower crime index, which in turn leads to higher happiness scores for countries.\n",
    "**Analysis**: We will run a multivariable linear regression to determine the correlation of the inputs of birth rate (number of live births per 1,000 people in the population), minimum wage (in dollars), crime index (out of 100), and population (in number of people) in affecting the output of happiness score. We will test whether 𝛽population< 0 , 𝛽birth_rate< 0, 𝛽min_wage > 0, and 𝛽crime< 0. Our formula would be: Happiness Score = α + βbirth_rate * Birth_rate + βminimum_wage * Minimum wage + βcrime * Crime + βpopulation * Population + ε."

We are only using information regarding the economy from this dataset, such as GDP, to analyze how economic factors within countries affect citizens’ happiness. We cleaned the rows with missing data and renamed some of the columns to clarify the unit and explain the economic terms. We created a column called ‘GDP Per Capita’ based on the provided GDP and Population information and divided them to gain this essential metric of economics. In addition, we removed special signs such as dollar signs and percentage signs and converted them to numbers for later analysis. We ended up with data for 128 countries."

The goal is to compare how crime index, minimum wage, and birth rate are correlated to population, and how population is correlated to happiness score.

    "1. Our analysis showed a __significant positive relationship between suicide rate and happiness score__. Looking at the coefficient and intercept of our linegraph, we can say theres a 22.59 increase in happiness score per 1 unit increase in suicide rate. Therefore, countries that reported to be happier had overall more suicides than countries that were deemed less happy. However, the bootstrapped data showed our data was varied and had wide range of outcomes. This could be due to the high R-square value (78%) which may have clouded our data. The OLS summary and permutation model showed that our data was significant, with our F-statistic being 9.58e-22. Additionally the p-value was 0.00, suggesting that 'suicide_rate' significantly predicted 'Happiness score'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. From the heatmap, we can see that crime index has a weak negative correlation with population (-0.053). Minimum wage also has a weak negative correlation with population (-0.13). Birth rate has a weak positive correlation with population (0.00076). From the heatmap, correlations between the various factors and population do not appear strong. We are particularly interested to see if there is a relationship between population size and happiness score. Population has a weak negative correlation with happiness score (-0.2). Thus, there does not appear to be a strong correlation between population and happiness score. According to the heatmap, minimum wage seems to have the strongest positive correlation to happiness score (0.62). Birth rate has the strongest negative correlation to happiness score (-0.58).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To answer our second research question, we ran an OLS regression model to examine the relationship between the happiness score of 72 countries and four independent variables: crime index, minimum wage, birth rate, and population. Based on the p-values, we can reject the null hypothesis for the coefficients of crime index and minimum wage, concluding that they are both statistically significant predictors of the happiness score. However, we cannot reject the null hypothesis for the coefficients of birth rate and population, which means that they are not statistically significant predictors of the happiness score. \n",

    "4. The model suggests that the condition number of the model is large (7.27e+07), which might indicate strong multicollinearity or other numerical problems. The population variable affects the reliability and accuracy of our model. We can consider transforming the Population variables to investigate these issues.\n",

    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings suggest a notable association between higher reported happiness and higher suicide rates among countries. While the regression model demonstrated significance, further scrutiny of assumptions and model refinement is crucial to ensure its reliability and applicability to varied scenarios. For future steps, I'd consider looking into the residual plots of the suicide rate. \n",

    "There does not appear to be strong correlations with crime index, minimum wage, and birth rate to population size. There also does not appear to be a strong correlation between population and happiness score."

    "__1.__ Here are some limitations of the health data:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The Suicide Number CSV could have accuracy problems through the collection process. It is hard to account for all the suicides globally since it doesn’t account for missing people, doesn’t account for underreportings, and we don’t know what constitutes as a suicide. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - When merging the different data frames, it was difficult to keep all the countries shared by the three data sets. Since we were inner joining, only countries that were on all datasets were included. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The data points are very scattered so its hard to indicate a pattern in the relationship of suicide rate and happiness score.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2.__ Though the global country information dataset is very comprehensive and has over 18,000 downloads, there isn’t clear documentation of its sources and how the data was collected. Thus, there is some ambiguity associated with reporting findings based on this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3.__ The world happiness report data is not up to date to 2023, so we have chosen to use the most recent data collected from 2022 in our analysis. This could potentially alter our findings as it may not completely and accurately reflect the current situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4.__ The world happiness report data was mainly collected through a survey, the Gallup World Survey. Thus, there could be selection biases in the responses and the data may not be completely representative of the whole population.\n",
    "\n",
    "__5.__ The Crime Rate By Country 2023 CSV doesn’t clearly explain how the 'crime index' is calculated, which raises concerns about potential bias in data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "__6.__ The geography map made it difficult to compare data between the suicide rate and happiness score since it quanitified the effects in number rather numerics. "
