    "## Research Question:\n",
    "Our research aims to understand which factors correlate with the general life satisfaction of various countries. Areas we are interested in analyzing include economic, health, and demography factors. In the economic realm, we want to understand how economic factors, such as GDP, minimum wage, cost of living, and crime rate can affect life satisfaction. In health, we are interested in understanding the link between suicides and mental disorders with happiness. For demography, we seek to understand if there are patterns between infant mortality rate, maternal mortality ratio, birth rate, and life expectancy with happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, which factors are the most prominent in influencing ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù? How can we predict the impact of different factors on countries‚Äô life satisfaction? "

    "## Data Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "### __MOTIVATION__\n",
    "__Why was this dataset created?__\n",
    "- Our dataset was created to observe the factors that influenced life satisfaction in various countries. We wanted to isolate factors that demonstrated the strongest correlation to overall happiness. The five datasets we analyzed all compared individual factors that would influence or measure the wellbeing of the country. Their purpose was to capture the overall state of different countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Who funded the creation of the dataset?__\n",
    "- These datasets took information from organizations like the ‚ÄúWorld Health Organization‚Äù, ‚ÄúWorld bank‚Äù statistics, United Nations Statistics, and other datasets. It is unclear who funded these datasets. \n",
    "### __Composition__\n",
    "__Is any information missing from individual instances?__\n",
    "- There is information missing from individual instances, such as data from smaller countries like Andorra, which may have less resources to collect the data. These rows of missing values have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?__\n",
    "\n",
    "- For these datasets, the rows are the names of countries, and the columns are health, economic, and demography factors. These include number of suicides, infant mortality rate, crime rates, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?__\n",
    "- The data has mainly been collected from research studies, using methods such as surveys. Thus, there could be several biases that could have influenced data collection, such as selection bias, sampling bias, and social desirability bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Collection Process__\n",
    "__How was the data associated with each instance acquired?__\n",
    "- We gathered the data from various CSV files in order to analyze various facets of influential attributes that impacted a nation. The individual CSV files took data from large health organizations that measured population statistics. Some examples are the \"https://ourworldindata.org/\", the \"Sustainable Development Solutions Network\", and the \"World Health Organization\".\n",
    "\n",
    "__Over what timeframe was the data collected?__\n",
    "- Our research analyzed data from the year 2013 to 2023. This data allows us to predict the more recent trends in Happiness levels, GDP, birth rate, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?__\n",
    "- The data scrapped data from large organizations that provided public data. They also took data from previous research studies that used the same data. The data was changed to its current form once we removed less relevant columns and collected the correlation value. Additionally we dropped empty column values to focus on the analyzable data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __Uses__\n",
    "__Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted on Github, in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).__\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we used 6 datasets. They can be found in their raw data sources as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mental health disorders dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/Mental%20health%20Depression%20disorder%20Data.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Suicide dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/master.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Demography and economic information dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/world-data-2023.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Crime information dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/crime-rate-by-country-2023.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Country and continent dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/countryContinent.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Happiness information dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/2022.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "__What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?__\n",
    "- These datasets contain a lot of rich information that can be used for a variety of different tasks. For example, other ideas that could be studied include the patterns between education levels and human development, between labor force participation and overall economic performance, and between urbanization trends and environmental consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?__\n",
    "- Some potential tasks that these data should not be used for are visualizing trends over time, because not all the datasets include data over time. Additionally, further verification of the data should be done before using it to inform any policy recommendations.\n",

    "## Preregistration Statements\n",
    "**Hypothesis 1**: \n",
    "Countries that are reported to have an overall higher rate of happiness will experience lower levels of suicide rates. \n",
    "**Analysis**: We will run a linear regression model to determine if there is a relationship between happiness score and suicide rates (number of suicides per 100,000 people).This would be our formula: Happiness Score = Œ± + Œ≤suicide_rate * Suicide Rate + Œµ. We will be looking to see if Œ≤suicide_rate < 0, to determine if there is a negative correlation between happiness and suicide rates per country.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2**: \n",
    "Smaller population sizes of countries correspond to lower birth rates, higher minimum wages, and lower crime index, which in turn leads to higher happiness scores for countries.\n",
    "**Analysis**: We will run a multivariable linear regression to determine the correlation of the inputs of birth rate (number of live births per 1,000 people in the population), minimum wage (in dollars), crime index (out of 100), and population (in number of people) in affecting the output of happiness score. We will test whether ùõΩpopulation< 0 , ùõΩbirth_rate< 0, ùõΩmin_wage > 0, and ùõΩcrime< 0. Our formula would be: Happiness Score = Œ± + Œ≤birth_rate * Birth_rate + Œ≤minimum_wage * Minimum wage + Œ≤crime * Crime + Œ≤population * Population + Œµ."

Since the data was not up to date, it could cause inaccuracies in our dataset, making it difficult to make predictions on life satisfaction. \n",

    "\n",
    "  - When merging the different data frames, it was difficult to keep all the countries shared by the three data sets. Since we were inner joining, only countries that were on all datasets were included. \n",
    "\n",
