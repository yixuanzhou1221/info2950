    "## Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "The question of happiness has been commonly pondered and explored throughout history. People have constantly looked for the best way to live their lives and seek happiness. Whether it's defined by personal achievements, meaningful relationships, or moments of delight, the concept of happiness is an important part of the human experience, shaping our perspectives, decisions, and the overall quality of our lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research aims to shed light on this question by examining how different areas of life can play a role in influencing countries' happiness scores. Though happiness has been commonly studied, our research is differentiated because it combines the impact of different factors in the areas of health, economics, and demography, which are typically analyzed separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, factors we have chosen to study are suicide rate, birth rate, minimum wage, crime index, and population size. We chose factors from a wide range of areas because we are interested in understanding if different aspects of lifestyle (ie. health, economics, and demography) have more weight than others in influencing happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how these various factors can influence happiness is important on a personal level because every individual is invested in their own happiness. However, this research can also be used extract broader insights into the way different societies are structured and how that can subsequently affect happiness. Thus, the findings from this research can be used as a basis for informing policy decisions that can have the potential to increase happiness worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms <a name=\"keyTerms\"></a>\n",
    "1) **Suicide rate**: Number of suicide deaths in a year, divided by the population and multiplied by 100,000.\n",
    "(Source: https://www.who.int/data/gho)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **World happiness score**: A publication that contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors.\n",

    "## Research Question <a name=\"researchQuestion\"></a>\n",
    "**Main Question**: Among the factors of suicide rate, birth rate, minimum wage, crime index, and population size, which are the most prominent in influencing “happiness”? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we use the following sub-questions to assist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Is there a relationship between the levels of suicide rate and a country's happiness score?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Does a smaller population size, lower birth rate, higher minimum wage, and lower crime index lead to a higher happiness score for countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Findings <a name=\"summary\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We began the project by cleaning the data, removing all the null values, the less relevant columns, and renaming any columns to make them more clear. We then converted the files into a CSV file to make it easier to edit and import into the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 1 Results:** We found that suicide rate **does not have an significant impact on happiness score**, and that suicide rate does not predict overall happiness in each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**:\n",
    "1. <u>Heatmap/Correlation Matrix </u>: We looked at the correlation between happiness and suicide rate to gauge the general relationship between the two variables. The heatmap helped us visualize the connection between the two. \n",
    "2. <u>Geography Map of Suicide Rate to Happiness Score</u>: We created two individual geography map of suicide rate and happiness. This allowed us to look at the magnitude of suicide rate and happiness score on a global scale. Additionally, the two maps side-to-side allowed us a quick and convenient way to compare the two variables. \n",
    "3. <u>Coefficient and Intercept + Line Plot Comparison</u>: We calculated for the coefficient and intercept through a linear regression model. This allowed us to observe a numeric value between happiness and suicide rates between countries. The line plot visualized this relationship making it easier to understand.\n",
    "4. <u>Bootstrap Graph + Confidence Interval</u>: We created a bootstrapped graph to visualize the various predicts trends of the model. We also calculated the confidence interval based off the slopes of the various graphs. This allowed us to estimate the variability and uncertainty associated with the regression coefficients. \n",
    "5. <u>OLS Regression Summary</u>: The OLS regression summary gave us the p-value of the data, enabling us to test for significance within the dataset. \n",
    "6. <u>Permutation</u>: We also created permutation graphs to understand the distribution and variability of a particular statistic under the assumption of no relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2 Results:** We found that minimum wage and population **positively predicts happiness score**, while birth rate **negatively predicts happiness score**. Lastly, the crime rate **does not significantly predict happiness rate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**:\n",
    "1. <u>Heteroskedasticity Check (Residual Plot)</u>: For the heteroskedasticity check, we created residual plots to check for the randomness of points. We wanted to ensure that the data was randomly distributed in preparation for the multiple linear regression, and perform transformations if necessary.\n",
    "2. <u>Log Transform Results</u>: The results of the residual plots show no heteroskedasticity, and therefore no need to transform any of the variables for that reason. However, due to the outliers we observed in the population data, we decided to log transform the population data to account for those outliers.\n",
    "3. <u>Multicollinearity Check (Correlation Matrix/Heatmap)</u>: We checked for multicollinearity to ensure that variables weren't too highly correlated. The purpose of this was to make sure that predictor variables didn't disproportionately affect regression outcomes. Using the correlation coefficent values from a correlation matrix and heatmap, we found that there is no multicollinearity.\n",

    "## Data Description: <a name=\"desc\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Motivation__\n",
    "__Why was this dataset created?__\n",
    "- Our dataset was created to observe the factors that influenced life satisfaction in various countries. We wanted to isolate factors that demonstrated the strongest correlation to overall happiness. The five datasets we analyzed all compared individual factors that would influence or measure the wellbeing of the country. Their purpose was to capture the overall state of different countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Who funded the creation of the dataset?__\n",
    "- These datasets took information from organizations like the “World Health Organization”, “World Bank” statistics, United Nations Statistics, and other datasets. It is unclear who funded these datasets. \n",
    "### __Composition__\n",
    "__Is any information missing from individual instances?__\n",
    "- There is information missing from individual instances, such as data from smaller countries like Andorra, which may have less resources to collect the data. These rows of missing values have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?__\n",
    "\n",
    "- For these datasets, the rows are the names of countries, and the columns are health, economic, and demography factors. These include number of suicides, infant mortality rate, crime rates, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?__\n",
    "- The data has mainly been collected from research studies, using methods such as surveys. Thus, there could be several biases that could have influenced data collection, such as selection bias, sampling bias, and social desirability bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Collection Process__\n",
    "__How was the data associated with each instance acquired?__\n",
    "- We gathered the data from various CSV files in order to analyze various facets of influential attributes that impacted a nation. The individual CSV files took data from large health organizations that measured population statistics. Some examples are the \"https://ourworldindata.org/\", the \"Sustainable Development Solutions Network\", and the \"World Health Organization\".\n",
    "\n",
    "__Over what timeframe was the data collected?__\n",
    "- Our research analyzed data from the year 2013 to 2023. This data allows us to predict the more recent trends in happiness levels, minimum wage, birth rate, and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?__\n",
    "- The data was scraped from large organizations that provided public data. Data was also used from previous research studies using the same data. The data was changed to its current form once we removed less relevant columns and collected the correlation value. Additionally, we dropped empty column values to focus on the analyzable data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __Uses__\n",
    "__Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted on Github, in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).__\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we used 6 datasets. They can be found in their raw data sources as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mental health disorders dataset:\n",
    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/Mental%20health%20Depression%20disorder%20Data.csv\n",

    "https://github.com/yixuanzhou1221/info2950/blob/main/Phase%202/2022.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "__What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?__\n",
    "- These datasets contain a lot of rich information that can be used for a variety of different tasks. For example, other ideas that could be studied include the patterns between education levels and human development, between labor force participation and overall economic performance, and between urbanization trends and environmental consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?__\n",
    "- Some potential tasks that these data should not be used for are visualizing trends over time, because not all the datasets include data over time.\n",

    "**Hypothesis 1**: \n",
    "Countries that are reported to have an overall higher rate of happiness will experience lower levels of suicide rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**: We will run a linear regression model to determine if there is a relationship between happiness score and suicide rates (number of suicides per 100,000 people).This would be our formula: Happiness Score = α + $β_{\\text{ Suicide rate}}$ * Suicide Rate + ε. We will be looking to see if $β_{\\text{ Suicide rate}}$ < 0, to determine if there is a negative correlation between happiness and suicide rates per country.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2**: \n",
    "Smaller population sizes of countries correspond to lower birth rates, higher minimum wages, and lower crime index, which in turn leads to higher happiness scores for countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**: We will run a multivariable linear regression to determine the correlation of the inputs of birth rate (number of live births per 1,000 people in the population), minimum wage (in dollars), crime index (out of 100), and population (in number of people) in affecting the output of happiness score. We will test whether $β_{\\text{ Population}} < 0$, $β_{\\text{ Birth rate}} < 0$, $β_{\\text{ Minimum wage}} > 0$, and $β_{\\text{ Crime index}} < 0$. Our formula would be: Happiness Score = α + $β_{\\text{ Birth rate}}$ * Birth rate + $β_{\\text{  Minimum wage}}$ * Minimum wage + $β_{\\text{ Crime index}}$ * Crime index + $β_{\\text{ Population}}$ * Population + ε."

This can be seen through our confidence interval; the 95% confidence interval was between **0.31 and 53.607**. This shows __uncertainty__ in our data due to the large disparity between the lower bound and the higher bound. Due to our findings, we will **fail to reject the null hypothesis** due to lack of significance in the data.

However, our findings lacked statistical significance across various analyses. The absence of clear significance, evidenced by non-significant p-values and uncertain outcomes within wide confidence intervals, suggests a need for a deeper exploration. We couldn't reject the idea that there's no relationship due to the lack of statistical weight.

A more nuanced investigation could reveal hidden factors and shed light on the true nature of this association.\n",

Lower birth rate corresponds to a higher happiness score, suggesting that increased access to contraception, education, and family planning might be beneficial in improving quality of life. Though it might seem counterintuitive that a larger population can lead to higher happiness, perhaps this is because larger populations have more diversity, opportunities, and cultural richness.\n",
